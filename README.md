## Overview
This project uses the U-Net deep learning architecture to segment brain tumors from MRI scans. The U-Net model is well-suited for biomedical image segmentation due to its fully convolutional nature and symmetric encoder-decoder structure.

## Requirements
To run this code, you need the following libraries and tools installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (if running interactively)

You can install all the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/U-Net-brain-tumor-segmentation.git
```
## Navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd U-Net-brain-tumor-segmentation

```

```bash
jupyter notebook U-NET-brain-tumor-image-segmentation.ipynb

```
## Training
The model can be trained using the provided notebook. The U-Net architecture is already set up to begin training with MRI images and their corresponding tumor masks.

Open the Jupyter notebook.
Load the dataset.
Run the cells to preprocess, train the model, and evaluate performance.
## Evaluation
After training, the model can be evaluated using the Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics. Visualizations of predicted masks against ground truth are also provided.

## Results
The model's performance can be visually assessed by comparing the predicted segmentation masks with the actual tumor boundaries from the dataset.

## Example visualizations:

Input Image	Ground Truth	Predicted Mask
## Usage
To use the trained model for segmenting new MRI images, you can modify the notebook's inference section. Upload your MRI scans, and the model will predict and output the segmentation masks.
